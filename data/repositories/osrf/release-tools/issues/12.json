Here are my thoughts about why is so slow and how can we improve it:\r\n\r\n### Why is currently slow? ###\r\n\r\n* It can only run in one of the jenkins slave nodes, where the credentials to upload packages to gazebosim and real repo packages.osrfoundation.org is hosted.\r\n* For gazebo, it can only be compiled using -j1 because of large amount of memory needed for multiple thread. This started when we add all the possible support (player, media libs, etc) inside the build.\r\n\r\n### What can be done to speed up the process? ###\r\n\r\n* Set up several machines to build packages. One option could be set up all slaves to build and upload packages to gazebosim and trigger a jenkins job at the node where the repo is hosted which will download the new package and set it up in the repo using reprepro.\r\n* Enable multiple compilation threads. This will need a research about why are we using those large amounts of memory and see if they are really needed. I suspect that sometimes we are abusing of linking libraries not needed. And, of course, the easy way, buy more memory.\r\n* Other improvements in gazebo build time:  there are ways of improving compilation time, like use of precompiled headers, play with the physical design of code to make things faster for the compiler, try other linkers/compilers, etc.\r\n* Performance tweaks in release scripts. Review what is being run in jenkins and check if there is something we can take out or change to gain some seconds.\r\n\r\nFeedback?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Currently our release process especially for gazebo.
