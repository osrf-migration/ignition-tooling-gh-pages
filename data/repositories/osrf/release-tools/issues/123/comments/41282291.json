This brings up 2 questions, one directly related to this issue and another more tangential one:\n\n## v0 and v1 side-by-side installation\n\nDo we want to support, say, installing `ign-msgs0` side-by-side with `ign-msgs1`? Note that Gazebo <= 8 will depend on 0 and Gazebo 9 will depend on 1. From the moment `ign-msgs1` is released, can a user still install msgs0 from debs?\n\n## Gazebo depending on ign-*0\n\nConsidering ign-*0 won't have stable APIs, Should we be releasing Gazebo versions which depend on version 0 of any ign-library? This has caused problems in the past, for example Gazebo 7 and 8 depend on ign-msgs0, but we eventually [broke compatibility](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-msgs/issues/7/need-an-ign_math2-compatible-branch). \n\nI guess one possible solution would be to treat 0.X minors as majors. That is, Gazebo shouldn't ever depend on just the ign-msgs0 major, but on a specific 0.N, and we should make sure to only introduce breaking changes on minors, and never on patches. Keep in mind that Gazebo 9 will depend on `ign-common0` (optionally?), `ign-fuel-tools0` (optionally?) and `ign-cmake0`, so there's a lot of potential for breakage.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks for the clarification.
