After fixing the compiler error, I found that I wasn't seeing the protobuf bug that motivated this patch.\n\nAfter further testing, I was able to reproduce the bug by using incorrect environment variables. This inspired me to try to fix the environment variables in our homebrew jenkins script (see [branch homebrew_gazebo_version](#!/osrf/release-tools/commits/branch/homebrew_gazebo_version)), but I ran into linking problems since we are not installing our jenkins code to `/usr/local`.\n\nI think this bug would be resolved with an unpatched protobuf formula if we change our jenkins script to install to `/usr/local`. This would yield other benefits, such as being able to install qt from a bottle, which would save probably 20 minutes per build.\n\nThe homebrew test bot installs to `/usr/local` (see [test-bot.rb](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/cmd/test-bot.rb)).
