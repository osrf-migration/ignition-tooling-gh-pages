It seemed rather onerous that the `release-tools` repo needed to be updated any time the dependencies of an ignition project get changed. This is especially problematic if different branches of a project have different dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows `release-tools` to be more generic on the Windows CI. Instead of dependencies being handled inside `release-tools`, they will be handled within the `configure.bat` file of each project (which can be changed between branches), and `release-tools` will provide some scripting helpers to make it easy for the individual `configure.bat` files to specify what their dependencies are and how to install them. That way `release-tools` can remain completely stable, even as projects' dependencies change over time.\r\n\r\nThere are three projects with pull requests that are associated with this proposal:\r\n\r\n1. [ign-cmake](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-cmake/pull-requests/6/)\r\n2. [ign-math](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-math/pull-requests/204/)\r\n3. [ign-common](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-common/pull-requests/82/)\r\n\r\nI recommend we wait until all of the related PRs are approved and merge them all simultaneously in order to have the least amount of friction in the CI.\r\n\r\nNote that the CI for all of `ign-cmake`, `ign-math`, and `ign-common` will now go through the `jenkins-scripts/lib/generic-default-devel-windows.bat` instead of needing their own setup scripts.\r\n\r\nFor projects that have not yet migrated, I've attempted to preserve backwards compatibility, but it may be a good idea to test your existing project against this branch to make sure it isn't doing something harmful.", "title": "Proposal: Updating to Visual Studio 2017 and improving Windows CI", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "2a3137030d39", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/release-tools/commit/2a3137030d39.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/release-tools/commits/2a3137030d39"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/release-tools.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/release-tools"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{41811d3d-19d0-428e-a134-976595e72508}ts=python"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "release-tools", "full_name": "osrf/release-tools", "uuid": "{41811d3d-19d0-428e-a134-976595e72508}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "171ff9617d1f", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/release-tools/commit/171ff9617d1f.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/release-tools/commits/171ff9617d1f"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/release-tools.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/release-tools"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{41811d3d-19d0-428e-a134-976595e72508}ts=python"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "release-tools", "full_name": "osrf/release-tools", "uuid": "{41811d3d-19d0-428e-a134-976595e72508}"}, "branch": {"name": "WindowsUpdate-Oct2017"}}, "state": "MERGED", "author": {"display_name": "Steve Peters", "uuid": "{2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fb4816dad9e68337d3096f750951f6cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsSP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "Steven Peters", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:5de38267-b118-494c-aa76-4fab35448816"}, "date": "2017-10-31T17:55:19.294905+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 463, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/release-tools/pullrequests/463.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/release-tools/pull-requests/463"}}, "title": "Proposal: Updating to Visual Studio 2017 and improving Windows CI"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/release-tools/pullrequests/463/comments/48375067.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/release-tools/pull-requests/463/_/diff#comment-48375067"}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 463, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/release-tools/pullrequests/463.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/release-tools/pull-requests/463"}}, "title": "Proposal: Updating to Visual Studio 2017 and improving Windows CI"}, "content": {"raw": "I'm planning to merge this tomorrow morning at 10 am if it still has just one approval so we can proceed with the next steps for ign-cmake.
