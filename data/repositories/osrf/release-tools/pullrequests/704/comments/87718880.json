I've fixed the mechanism to remove packages from vcpkg before the build by adding `--recurse` and I think that I was able to reproduce your error here: [https://build.osrfoundation.org/job/gazebo-ci-pr\\_any-windows7-amd64/2424/consoleFull](https://build.osrfoundation.org/job/gazebo-ci-pr_any-windows7-amd64/2424/consoleFull) .
